Tensorflow 2.0 Concepts and Exercises 
These content of this video has been taken from NPTEL series Practical Machine Learning with Tensorflow. Dr.Ashish Tendulkar has explained the concepts in a very easy and intuitive way. These are my notes from the sessions.
Tensorflow is an end2end opensource platform for machine learning. Tensorflow is meant from two words. Tensor(multidimensional array) and flow (graph of operations)
Internally TensorFlow implements a machine learning algorithm as graph of operations in a multidimensional array.
